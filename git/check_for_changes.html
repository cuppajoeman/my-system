title: check for changes
---

<p>
    When working from multiple different computers one of the most annoying things is forgetting to commit changes and then not being able to continue work. This problem gets amplified if you have multiple projects. Therefore a quick sanity checking script is welcome:
</p>

<div class="code-file" data-file-name="../check_for_changes.py"></div>

<p>
    Note that gitpython must be installed for this to work. Simply run this script in the directory you'd like to start the recursive search.
