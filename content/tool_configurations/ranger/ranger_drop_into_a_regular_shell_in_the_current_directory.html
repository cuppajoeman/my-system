<p>
    When using ranger I like to use it to navigate to where I really want to be and then run some commands in that location, I've been using S for that, but the problem is that creates a subshell, so running ranger again creates a nested ranger instance, which isn't necessarily bad, but then leaving the shell I have to type exit many times, I wanted this to be cleaner.
