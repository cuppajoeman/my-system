  Installing packages manually is what is recommended by the arch wiki, but eventually that gets tiresome so I installed yay which automates parts of building aur packages.

<h1>how to get it</h1>
<p>
  First and foremost follow the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_User_Repository#Installing_and_upgrading_packages">wiki guide on getting aur packages</a>, but I will maintain a quick version here for myself:
</p>
<pre>
  <code>
# Install Git
sudo pacman -S git

# Clone the Yay repository into /opt directory
# /opt is used to store optional or third-party software
# that is not managed by the default package manager.
cd /opt
sudo git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay-git.git

# Change the ownership of the Yay directory to the current user
# This is necessary because the repository was cloned as root, 
# so the user must take ownership to build and manage the package 
# without requiring root privileges.
sudo chown -R $(whoami):$(whoami) ./yay-git

# Navigate to the cloned directory
cd yay-git

# Install the required development tools and build the Yay package
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel
makepkg -si
    </code>
</pre>
