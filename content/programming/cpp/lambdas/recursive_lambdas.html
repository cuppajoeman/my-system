Working with lambdas is great in c++, but sometimes you want to make recursive lambdas, there are a few pitfalls that I've been in. I'm listing them here to pull me (or you!) out in the future :)

<h1>Gotcha's</h1>

<h2>bad_function_call issue</h2>

<p>The following code example produces a bad function call due to capturing the lambda by value:</p>
<pre><code>// Declaration
std::function&lt;void(const SBone*, const core::vector3df&amp;, const core::quaternion&amp;)&gt; f_build;

f_build = [f_build](const SBone* bone, const core::vector3df&amp; pos, const core::quaternion&amp; rot)
{
    // This will cause a "bad call" due to incomplete capture of f_build
    f_build(bone, pos, rot);
};
</code></pre>

<h2>Corrected Code</h2>
<p>The issue is resolved by capturing the lambda by reference:</p>
<pre><code>// Declaration
std::function&lt;void(const SBone*, const core::vector3df&amp;, const core::quaternion&amp;)&gt; f_build;

f_build = [&amp;f_build](const SBone* bone, const core::vector3df&amp; pos, const core::quaternion&amp; rot)
{
    // This will correctly call the fully initialized f_build
    f_build(bone, pos, rot);
};
</code></pre>

<h2>Explanation</h2>
<p>Here's why capturing by value causes a "bad call":</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Copy of <code>f_build</code></strong>: When capturing by value, the lambda captures a copy of the <code>f_build</code> variable. However, at the point of the lambda's creation, <code>f_build</code> is not fully initialized. It is still being defined, leading to an incomplete or invalid function.</li>
    <li><strong>Uninitialized or Incomplete State</strong>: The lambda inside the <code>f_build</code> variable refers to an incomplete or invalid function, which results in a "bad call" when the lambda tries to invoke itself.</li>
    <li><strong>Reference to <code>f_build</code></strong>: Capturing <code>f_build</code> by reference (<code>[&amp;f_build]</code>) ensures that the lambda uses the actual <code>f_build</code> variable, which will eventually hold the fully initialized lambda function.</li>
    <li><strong>Correct Recursive Call</strong>: By capturing by reference, the recursive call inside the lambda correctly invokes the complete and fully initialized lambda function, allowing recursion to work as intended.</li>
</ul>
