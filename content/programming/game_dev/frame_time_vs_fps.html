<p>In the context of gaming and graphics, <strong>FPS (frames per second)</strong> is commonly used to measure the performance of a system. However, FPS alone doesn't always tell the full story. Another important metric is <strong>frame time</strong>, which is the time it takes to render each individual frame. Frame time is more directly related to system performance and can give you a clearer understanding of smoothness and consistency.</p>

<h2>Frame Time vs FPS</h2>
<p>Frame rate (FPS) is the reciprocal of frame time. This means:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Frame rate (FPS) = <strong>1 / frame time</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>As frame time approaches 0, the frame rate tends toward infinity, which theoretically means an infinite number of frames can be rendered in a second. However, in practical terms, this is not achievable, and the law of diminishing returns kicks in. At higher FPS levels, improvements in smoothness become less noticeable.</p>

<h2>Common FPS Values and Their Corresponding Frame Times</h2>
<p>Below is a table that shows common FPS values and their corresponding frame times. As you can see, frame time decreases as FPS increases.</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>FPS</th>
            <th>Frame Time (ms)</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>30 FPS</td>
            <td>33.33 ms</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>60 FPS</td>
            <td>16.67 ms</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>120 FPS</td>
            <td>8.33 ms</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>144 FPS</td>
            <td>6.94 ms</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>240 FPS</td>
            <td>4.17 ms</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>300 FPS</td>
            <td>3.33 ms</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1000 FPS</td>
            <td>1.00 ms</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>As shown in the table, increasing the FPS decreases the frame time, which results in faster rendering of each frame. However, the improvements become less noticeable as FPS increases, especially beyond 60-120 FPS. For instance, going from 30 FPS to 60 FPS offers a clear improvement in smoothness, but going from 240 FPS to 300 FPS offers very little perceived difference, even though the frame time has decreased further.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>While FPS is a useful metric, frame time is often a better indicator of how well a system is performing, especially in terms of consistency and smoothness. Frame time is linearly related to FPS, and understanding this relationship allows developers and users to focus on more meaningful performance metrics for an improved experience.</p>
