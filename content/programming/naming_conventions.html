  Here are some conventions that I use while writing code, so that anyone reading my code knows what's going on.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>I use snake case, as it's been proven to be faster to read: https://www.cs.kent.edu/~jmaletic/papers/ICPC2010-CamelCaseUnderScoreClouds.pdf, and I like it more</li>
  <li>In general I name my variables in noun_adjective form eg) <code>max_value</code></li>
  <li>I don't use hungarian notation, which is the practice of embedding type, purpose, or usage instead I just describe what it does</li>
  <li>I make my variable almost completely describe what they do when the code is complex, in those cases if the variable name gets too long then I start creating short forms</li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>less_than_or_equal_to_list</code> may become <code>ltoetl</code> whenever a shortening occurs, there will be a comment above it with its full name, so if you see something you don't understand check that out.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li><code>blah_idx</code> is a index into something</li>
  <li><code>avg</code> is an average of something</li>
  


</ul>
