  I was trying to figure out how I can cross compile from linux to windows, I initially noticed that settings.yml said nothing about mingw and so I got a little confused, eventually I found a sample profile which was outdated and used some broken packages like mingw_installer which no longer existed, at the end of the day I was able to get it to work like this. Create the following windows conan profile:
</p>

<pre>
  <code>
[tool_requires]
mingw-w64/8.0.2

[settings]
os=Windows
arch=x86_64
compiler=gcc
compiler.cppstd=17
compiler.version=14
compiler.libcxx=libstdc++11
compiler.threads=posix
build_type=Release

  </code>
</pre>

<p>
  Then navigate to your project directory and run 
</p>

<pre>
  <code>
    conan install . -pr:b=default -pr:h=windows --build=missing
  </code>
</pre>

<span class="warning">note that I had to blast away my previous build directory because it had contained the linux build data and I think it just combined it with the new mingw stuff causing a problem during compilation the first time</span>

<p>
  From there it successfully built my required packages using mingw and I used cmake --preset conan-release and then cmake --build --preset conan-release and then it compiled, I got an unrelated error during my first go with cmake building because I forgot to set the cppstd to the same that of which I built the linux version with, so don't forget things like that.
