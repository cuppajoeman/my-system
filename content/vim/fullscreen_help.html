<p>
    sometimes when you're reading vim's built in help you want it to take up the entire page
</p>

<h2>using tabs</h2>

<p>
    run <code>:tab help [help query]</code>, this will open the help for that search in a new tab, there is fine for a one off search, but if you're planning on doing multiple help queries you'd end up with many tabs, which might not be what you want
</p>

<h2>making help the only screen</h2>

<p>
    with this approach, start by opening help regularly, it should open it in a split, then run <code>ctrl-w o</code> to make it the only visible window. Now you can use the <code>:help</code> command many times over, while maintaining fullscreen. TODO how to exit that window safely
