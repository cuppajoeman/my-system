    As mentioned in previous posts, the simplest way to get programs from this site is to just download them directly. With this approach you won't ever receive updates/improvements to any of the programs, which isn't necessarily a problem. On the other hand if you do want to get updates on the programs one option is to simply git clone the entire repository to your computer and pull changes, though this might not be optimal, because then you'd also get changes to random things which you might not care about, in this case we'll create a simple program which can take care of these issues.

    This program simply grabs checksums from the most recent programs (TODO checksum a link) and checks to see if the program you requested has the newest version, if not it will prompt you to download the newest version.
