    This is a repository of programs and ideas that I find useful, I put stuff here that doesn't warrant it's own repository, but is useful nonetheless.
</p>

<p>
    There are two main ways I imagine interacting with this site, the first being that you simply read the content online, and the second cloning the project to your computer to run the specific programs. The reason why the latter may be preffered is that if you simply read the pages on the site and you want to run one of the programs you might try to copy and paste the code into a file and then run it, by cloning the project to your computer you'll be able to run the programs directly without that intermediate step.

If you want to clone with http run this: <code>git clone https://github.com/cuppajoeman/toolbox.git</code> with ssh use: <code>git clone git@github.com:cuppajoeman/toolbox.git</code>

<h3>contributing</h3>

<p>
    In order to contribute to the toolbox you can simply write html without any header or anything, just imagine you're writing content inside of a body tag which is automatically inserted. <a href="https://github.com/cuppajoeman/toolbox">Here is the source code</a>
</p>

<p>
    If you're adding code, please try to put it in a proper file type, and then use the following mechanism:
</p>

<pre>
    &lt;div class=&quot;code-file&quot; data-file-name=&quot;convex_hull.py&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

<p>
    This makes it easier to run if you clone the repo so file contents don't have to be copied manually
