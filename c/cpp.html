<p>
    In this article I'll give you a roadmap on how you can learn cpp for free. While it's easy to recommend someone a textbook and that be the end of it all, it's not as simple as that. Firstly programmers usually want to become adept as quickly as possible so that they can write code without understanding everything, and then slowly learning more and more features when they need to know.
