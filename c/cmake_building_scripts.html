title: command line c
---

<p>
    When working with c or c++ in the command line I usually make scripts to help me with common tasks. Usually I will make a few scripts to activate different kinds of builds quickly
</p>

<p><span class="goal">These scripts should be project independent so that we can re-use them in any given c/c++ project.</span></p>

<p>
    <i>Note: My toolchain is cmake for builds, clang for formatting, and bash for scripting</i>
</p>

<p>
    The first step of this process is to create a scripts dir in the root of the project
</p>

<p>

    We'll start with a script which moves us to the correct directory: <code>scripts/move_to_base_project_dir.sh</code>
</p>


<div class="code-file" data-file-name="../move_to_base_project_dir.sh"></div>

Notes:

<ul>
    <li>we're making this a script because if we ever change our project dir we can still use these scripts from anywhere</li>
    <li>[your project directory] must be an absolute path, this is because we will run this script multiple times, if it was a relative path say "..", then we would continually be moving back a directory.</li>
    <li><span class="todo">Add an argument to each script which mentions if it's already in the project dir, if it is don't cd again, this will allow support for relative paths</span></li>
</ul>

<h1>cmake scripts</h1>

<h2>compiling a program</h2>

<p>
    Because <code>cmake</code> provides a solution to a complex problem, it is highly configurable, and usually a highly configurable systems make doing simple things a little more involved, indeed this manifests itself in cmake while trying to build a simple project. Here's the breakdown
</p>

<p>With cmake we start by generating the build system (on my machine this will create a makefile)</p>

<div class="code-file" data-file-name="../generate_build_system.sh"></div>

<p>Next we can build the project</p>

<div class="code-file" data-file-name="../build.sh"></div>

<p>If we want to generate the build system and build all at once</p>

<div class="code-file" data-file-name="../build_process.sh"></div>

<p>Now that you've built your project run it</p>

<div class="code-file" data-file-name="../run.sh"></div>

<p>You've made some edits, and you want to build and run the program</p>

<div class="code-file" data-file-name="../build_and_run.sh"></div>

<p>Notice that the only parameters to these scripts were the executable name and the project directory, to complete our goal, we should store these in a file and load them in dynamically</p>
